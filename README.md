## Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato Dataset

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset. The Zomato dataset contains information about various restaurants, their locations, cuisines, ratings, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the Zomato dataset by exploring and analyzing the data. The EDA process will involve examining different aspects of the dataset, such as:

- Basic statistics of the dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploring relationships between variables
- Analyzing restaurant ratings and reviews
- Visualizing data using charts and graphs

## Dataset

The Zomato dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://github.com/nishanthan-k/zomato-eda-analysis/tree/main/dataset). It consists of a CSV file containing information about restaurants in various locations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the Zomato dataset file(s)
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project

## Requirements

To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Results

The findings and insights from the EDA process will be documented in the notebooks as well.
